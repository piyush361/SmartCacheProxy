Project Design Document

Overview
--------
This project implements a multi-threaded HTTP proxy server with caching, pluggable eviction policies, logging, and connection pooling. 
It listens for client connections, handles HTTP requests, caches responses, and forwards requests to a remote server if necessary.

Components
----------

1. Socket Listener
   - Purpose: Accept incoming client connections.
   - Details:
     - Opens a TCP socket on a configurable port.
     - Uses accept() to receive connections.
     - Spawns a dedicated thread per client for concurrent request handling.

2. Client Handler Threads
   - Purpose: Process HTTP requests from connected clients.
   - Responsibilities:
     - Receive HTTP requests from clients.
     - Check the cache for a stored response.
     - Return response on cache hit.
     - Forward request to remote server on cache miss and store the response in cache.
   - Concurrency: Each client connection runs in its own thread.

3. Cache
   - Purpose: Store responses for previously requested HTTP resources to reduce latency.
   - Features:
     - Pluggable eviction policies: LRU (Least Recently Used), LFU (Least Frequently Used)
     - Thread-safe access for concurrent client threads.
     - Tracks hits and misses for logging.

4. Logger Thread
   - Purpose: Monitor cache statistics and log events.
   - Responsibilities:
     - Record cache hits and cache misses.
     - Periodically write statistics to a log file.
     - Runs in a separate thread to avoid blocking client processing.

5. Connection Pool
   - Purpose: Maintain persistent client connections efficiently.
   - Implementation:
     - Uses a pool data structure to track active connections.
     - Managed with epoll() for scalable event-driven monitoring.
     - Reduces overhead of repeatedly opening and closing connections.
